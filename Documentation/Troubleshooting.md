Troubleshooting
===============

#### Audio plays with no animation and there are no FaceFX errors in the log

Make sure the character's **Animation Blueprint** is referenced in the **Blueprint Class**, the **Blend FaceFX Animation** Blueprint node is added to the **Animation Blueprint**, and it is connected properly.

#### All other issues

Make sure there are no FaceFX warnings or errors in the log (launch the Unreal Editor with the **-Log** option). Otherwise, let us know, so we can add the issue here!
